## Frontend Code Assignmet

This was an Assignmet to meet the following specs:

1. When user opens the pages, the user sees collapsed skill categories.
2. Clicking any of skill category buttons expand it.
3. If less than 5 skills selected, we’ll display an error.
4. Clicking either the checkbox or title should toggle the skill and update the ”X skills selected” text.
5. Final screen should list all chosen skills.

Which were all met. You can see the working demo of the above specs [here](https://skillselection.herokuapp.com/)
